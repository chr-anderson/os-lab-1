# os-lab-1
 Repository to hold files for OpticStudio Lab 1.

## Contents

* **interference_intensity_profiles:** Contains intensity data exported from OpticStudio and a Jupyter notebook to plot this data in Python.
  * **DoubleData.txt:** The intensity at each pixel on the detector (401 x 401 pixels) for the double-slit arrangement.
  * **MultipleData.txt:** The intensity at each pixel on the detector (401 x 401 pixels) for the quadruple-slit arrangement.
  * **InterferencePatterns.ipynb:** A Jupyter notebook that reads the intensity data and plots the intensity of each pixel that's located at y = 201.
  * **IntensityPlot.png:** The plot generated by the Jupyter notebook.

* **PythonSinglet.py:** Python script to programmatically build a singlet by interfacing with OpticStudio using the ZOS-API. This script was developed from boilerplate code provided by Zemax for opening a connection to OpticStudio.
